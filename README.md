Generated bibliography in Pelican that can be rendered in references and citations

This plugin provides a new generator, `BibliographyGenerator`. This generator adds `bibliography` to the Pelican context and can write an output file for each reference using a `citation.html` template. Additionally, the entire bibliography can be written using a `bibliography.html` template or otherwise.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

```
pip install pelican-bibliography
```

Now, add it to your `pelicanconf.py`:

```
PLUGINS = ['pelican.plugins.bibliography']
```

That's it, thanks to the [namespace plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) in Pelican 4.5+.

## Usage

When this generator is run, it first reads bibliography files from the `BIBLIOGRAPHY_PATHS` setting. For now, only BibTeX (`.bib`) files are supported, but more may be added in the future. Each reference contained in the bibliography is instantiated as a `Reference` object. The content of the reference is its citation in bibtex, while most of the useful information is in the metadata, such as the citation key, the title, the authors, the publication venue. Extra metadata key-value pairs can be read from YAML files in the same bibliography path. Now, you can use `bibliography` in your templates.

Next, the citations can be written to separate files. If desired, for each reference, the citation will be rendered according to the `citation.html` template and written to a configured path. Ideally, your bibliography will link to the citation page so that interested readers can easily cite your work.

### Configuration

The following variables can be configured in your `pelicanconf.py`:

```
# A directory that contains the bibliography-related templates
BIBLIOGRAPHY_TEMPLATES: Union[str, os.PathLike]

# A list of directories and files to look at for bibliographies, relative to PATH.
BIBLIOGRAPHY_PATHS: List[str]

# A list of directories to exclude when looking for pages
BIBLIOGRAPHY_EXCLUDES: List[str]

# list of file extensions (without leading period) that are bibliography files
BIBLIOGRAPHY_EXTENSIONS: List[str]

# list of file extensions (without leading period) that are metadata files
BIBLIOGRAPHY_METADATA_EXTENSIONS: List[str]

# attribute of the Reference object to order the bibliography by (in reverse order)
BIBLIOGRAPHY_ORDER_BY: str

# whether to write citations to files
BIBLIOGRAPHY_WRITE_CITATIONS: bool

# template to use for citations
BIBLIOGRAPHY_CITATION_TEMPLATE_NAME: str

# path prefix to save citations as in generated site
BIBLIOGRAPHY_CITATIONS_PATH: Union[str, os.PathLike]
```

### Bibliography page

A main application of this is to create a research page that displays some collection of published research. For example, you could create a new template in your theme, `bibliography.html` that renders your research:

```
Here are the titles of my papers:
<ul>
    {% for ref in bibliography %}
    <li>{{ ref.title }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

You can't just create your bibliography in your site's `content/`, because the context that includes the articles, pages, bibliography, etc. is not available when your content is read. What you can do is create a new template that extends `page.html` or `article.html`, and use that template to render some text in your content tree.

A basic bibliography template is included with the plugin that tries to extend your theme's page template. Thus you could render your bibliography by adding this page to your content:

```markdown
Title: My Bibliography
Template: bibliography

Here is my bibliography
```

### Extra metadata

You can also provide additional metadata in a YAML file with the following structure:
```yaml
- key: someCitationKey2020
  metadata:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
```

Now the keys and values in the metadata hash associated with the citation key will be available in the corresponding `ref.metadata` dictionary in the `bibliography`.

### Styling

The `bibliography.html` default template that is included with the package has its own styling for jump links and highlighting. You can customize additional elements. For example, to style specific authors:

```css
.ref-author[data-family="Micah J."][data-family="Smith"] {
    text-weight: bold;
}
```

You can use multiple selectors to apply styles to the `ref-author` span with data attributes matching a certain name.
